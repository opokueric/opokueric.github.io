Our services:
* We evaluate the impact of disease exposure, healthcare interventions or programs, policies, and services on socioeconomic and health outcomes in the real-world settings. 
* We provide health economics training to healthcare administrators, pharmacists, physicians, nutritionists and nurses.
* We conduct risk prediction analysis. We use machine learning tools for exploring the important predictors of a research outcome and employ causal inference to investigate which of them is a significant determinant of the outcome.
* We champion health innovations and data linkages to support healthcare delivery and research, respectively.
