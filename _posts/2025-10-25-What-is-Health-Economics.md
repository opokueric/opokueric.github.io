Health Economics is the application of theoretical economic concepts for research, intervention evaluations and policy analysis in the healthcare industry. Health economic tools are relevant in many health-related professions including nursing, nutrition, medicine, healthcare administration, and pharmacy. Health Economics is mostly interested in the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions, policies, and services.

Outcomes Research focuses on the impact, safety and effectiveness of health interventions on health outcomes.
